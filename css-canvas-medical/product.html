        <p>You don't have to click a dozen times to order a flu shot or bounce around five windows to discover the last
          blood count. Canvas pulls everything you need
          directly into your note, so you never have to leave it. And because Canvas learns from every interaction, it
          gets smarter with every patient you see.</p>

        <p class="quote">"Canvas works three times as fast, improves performance dramatically on key quality metrics,
          and is incredibly easy to use. The right information
          is presented in the right way at the right time, and the product leverages technology to actually improve the
          quality of care I provide."</p>

          important questions. But I just couldn't get an answer from
          our old system! Canvas is light-years ahead."</p>

        <p>Clinical quality and revenue cycle reports can help you understand performance, but they aren't enough to improve quality
          and increase revenue day after day. Canvas automates quality protocols and charge capture so clinicians can focus on more
          complex work only they can do.</p>

          to keep up. We're a small practice and we don't have a big quality team or a group of coders to catch everything. The automation in Canvas
          has completely eliminated my concerns around quality and revenue performance."</p>
