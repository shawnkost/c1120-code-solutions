        <p>You don't have to click a dozen times to order a flu shot or bounce around five windows to discover the last
          blood count. Canvas pulls everything you need
          directly into your note, so you never have to leave it. And because Canvas learns from every interaction, it
          gets smarter with every patient you see.</p>

        <p class="quote">"Canvas works three times as fast, improves performance dramatically on key quality metrics,
          and is incredibly easy to use. The right information
          is presented in the right way at the right time, and the product leverages technology to actually improve the
          quality of care I provide."</p>

          Easily reach out to any subgroup of your population with proactive interventions, and take comfort knowing
          you're a step ahead.</p>

          according to the most recent guidelines? That doesn't seem like a lot to ask and those are tremendously
          important questions. But I just couldn't get an answer from
          our old system! Canvas is light-years ahead."</p>
